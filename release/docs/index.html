        <h2 id="Managed">Managed vs Unmanaged</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>fTelnet comes in both Managed and Unmanaged versions, and I can't stress enough how much I recommend using the managed version.</p>
            <p>Why do I recommend the managed version?  Because it's pretty much foolproof (no offense intended!), and doesn't require you to keep anything up to date, I do all that for you.</p>
            <p>So if you want to stop reading now and go try the managed version instead, head on over to the <a href="http://embed.ftelnet.ca/wizard.html">Embed Wizard</a>.  Seriously, you'll be up and running in under 5 minutes.  It's awesome.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>I see you're still reading, so I guess you don't want to use the managed version...that sucks because I put a lot of effort into getting that up and running!</p>
            <p>Anyway, before you 100% decide which version to run, check of these differences:</p>

        <h2 id="Support">How to get support</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Email is the only way to get ahold of me.  Usually I'm pretty good about answering quickly, but sometimes I need a break from the computer and it may take a day or two.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to read this entire document and <a href="../demos/index.html">check out the demos</a> before contacting me.  I created the managed version to make things easy for you, so if you're deciding to use the unmanaged version that tells me you're looking for a challenge, and so you need to put some effort into said challenge before asking for help.</p>

        <div class="well">
            <p>Installing is pretty simple.  If you're reading this that means you've already downloaded and extracted the archive, so just put all these files into an fTelnet directory on your webserver and you're good to go.</p>

        <div class="well">
            <!--TODOX This will have to be updated-->
            <p>Using fTelnet is almost as easy as installing it was.  First you need to include the correct files.  Assuming you have an index.html in your document root, and fTelnet in a subdirectory called fTelnet, you can do that by putting this in your &lt;body> section where you want the client to appear:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;div id="fTelnetContainer">&lt;/div><br />
                &lt;!-- Javascript used to power fTelnet --><br />
                &lt;script src="fTelnet/fTelnet.min.js" id="fTelnetScript">&lt;/script><br />
                &lt;script><br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; fTelnet.Init();
                &lt;/script><br />
            </code>
            <p>That should now get you up and running.  Want a more complete example?  <a href="../demos/index.html">Check out the demos</a></p>

        <h2 id="Customize">How to customize</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Ahh, now we get to the meat of the document.  You've installed fTelnet, you've got it up and running, and now you want to customize it (what, you mean you DIDN'T want it to just connect to my server?!?)</p>
            <p>So here's a complete (at the time of this writing, hopefully I'll remember to keep it up to date in the future!) list of variables that you can customize.  You should assign values to these variables right before you call fTelnet.Init().  You should be able to assign them after you call fTelnet.Init(), but some of them may cause flicker (ie font or screen size changes), so best to do it before.</p>

        <h2 id="IE8">Internet Explorer 8 (and older) Support</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Internet Explorer 8 (and older) do not support the Canvas element, and while there are polyfills, none of them have support for the features fTelnet needs.  So unfortunately IE8 (and older) will never be supported.</p>

        <h2 id="Problems">Common Problems</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>There's a few things that are easy to miss that make a big difference between fTelnet working and not working.  So a few of them are:</p>

            <h3>I don't see the client anywhere</h3>
            <blockquote>Did you call <strong>fTelnet.Init();</strong> at the bottom of your page/in an on document ready event?</blockquote>

            <!--TODOX-->
            <h3>I get a popup error that says "fTelnet Error: Element with id="fTelnetContainer" was not found"</h3>
            <blockquote>You need a placeholder element (usually a div) with <strong>id="fTelnetContainer"</strong> on your page somewhere.  When you call fTelnet.Init(), it'll put the fTelnet client into that placeholder element.</blockquote>

            <h3>The button bar links/status bar look plain</h3>
            <blockquote>Did you add a reference to <strong>ftelnet.css</strong>?</blockquote>

            <h3>The virtual keyboard looks ugly</h3>
            <blockquote>Did you add the placholder stylesheet element with the <strong>id="fTelnetKeyboardCss"</strong>?  And also use <strong>id="fTelnetScript"</strong> when referencing the <strong>ftelnet.min.js</strong> script?</blockquote>

            <h3>I get an error/don't see anything with Internet Explorer 8 and older</h3>
            <blockquote>Did you add the <strong>&lt;!-- Stop IE8 and below from complaining about Object.defineProperty --></strong> code to your page?  That fixes the error.  It still doesn't fix the client though, IE8 and older don't support Canvas, so all you'll see is "fTelnet Error: Internet Explorer < 9 is not supported."</blockquote>

            <h3>Uploading and downloading don't work</h3>
            <blockquote>Those features work for me in all the desktop browsers (well not IE9, but it doesn't use real WebSockets), so if you're using a desktop browser get ahold of me and let me know what browser+version.  I haven't had as much luck with the mobile browsers though, so don't bother reporting problems there because there's probably not much I can do.</blockquote>
