This is the re-imagining of the iconic Iniquity Bulletin Board Software.

## Synopsis

npm install @iniquitybbs/fTelnet
Then you can use it in your project...

```shell
npx fTelnet
```

Now go to localhost:8888 and you should be able to connect to any telnet server running on port 23.

## About

In my opinion fTelnet is the best web based telnet engine out there. But I needed it to behave in a certain way for use with Iniquity so I'm currently maintaining a fork of it. I try to sync with Rick's upstream master branch as often as required. I have added some new features to fTelnet.
